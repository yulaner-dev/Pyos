# Pyos
Pyos is an simulation of an basic os made for sun by Yulaner-dev!
also it might not work i made it in LINUX version of VS Code. 
also if the "/PyOS1.06/PyOS_Files" dosent exist make a folder called "PyOS_Files" inside "PyOS1.06" and put a folder called ".RecycleBin" inside the "/PyOS1.06/PyOS_Files" so make "/PyOS1.06/PyOS_Files/.RecycleBin" if it dosent exist. and enjoy!
